After completion of this course, you'll be able to: 
>- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
>- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.
>- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.
>- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.
>- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.
>- Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.
>- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
>- Build a deep reinforcement learning model.

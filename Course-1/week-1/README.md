### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning

#### What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning** is defined as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn **without being explicitly programmed**.

The concept is best illustrated by Arthur Samuel’s 1950s checkers program:

- **The Innovation:** Instead of writing specific rules for every move, Samuel wrote a program that allowed the computer to learn through experience.
    
- **The Result:** Despite Samuel not being a strong checkers player himself, the computer eventually surpassed his own skill level by "learning" from the game data.

#### Types of Machine Learning:

- **Supervised Learning:** The most widely used in real-world applications and the primary focus of the first two courses.
    
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Used for finding patterns in data; covered in the third course.
    
- **Recommender Systems & Reinforcement Learning:** Additional specialized types of ML that will be explored later.

- **The "Tools vs. Skills" Philosophy:** Knowing the algorithms (the tools) is not enough. Just as having a hammer doesn't make you a carpenter, knowing an algorithm doesn't mean you know how to build a functioning system.
    
- **Focus on Practical Application:** A major goal of the course is to teach **best practices**. This helps avoid the common mistake of spending months on an approach that is destined to fail.

#### Supervised Learning

- **Economic Impact:** Supervised learning currently accounts for approximately **99% of the economic value** generated by machine learning.
    
- **The Core Mechanism ($x \rightarrow y$):** At its heart, supervised learning is about learning **input-to-output mappings**.
    
    - **Input ($x$):** The data you provide to the system.
        
    - **Output ($y$):** The prediction or "label" the system produces.
        
- **The "Supervision" Aspect:** The algorithm learns by being shown **"right answers."** You provide it with a dataset containing pairs of inputs and their correct corresponding labels.
    
- **The Goal:** By observing these correct pairs, the algorithm eventually learns to take a **new input ($x$)** on its own and produce a **reasonably accurate prediction ($y$)**.

**Examples of Supervised Learning Applications:**

| **Application**         | **Input (x)**              | **Output (y)**                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Spam Filter**         | Email content              | Is it spam? (Yes/No)                  |
| **Speech Recognition**  | Audio clip                 | Text transcript                       |
| **Machine Translation** | English text               | Translated text (e.g., Spanish)       |
| **Online Advertising**  | Ad info + User info        | Will the user click? (Yes/No)         |
| **Self-Driving Cars**   | Camera image + Sensor data | Position of other cars                |
| **Manufacturing**       | Photo of a product         | Is it defective? (Scratch/Dent/Clean) |

**The Training Process:** In every case, the model is first **trained** on a dataset of known pairs (inputs with their "right answers"). Once trained, it can then process **new, unseen data** to predict the correct output.

![Housing Price Prediction](./images/03-housing-price-prediction.png)

**The Example:** Predicting the price of a house ($y$) based on its size ($x$) using historical data where the "right answers" (actual sale prices) are already known.
    
- **Model Fitting:** Algorithms can represent data in different ways to make predictions:
    
    - **Straight Line:** A simple linear approach.
        
    - **Curve:** A more complex function that may fit the data more accurately.
        
- **Systematic Choice:** A key part of machine learning is using mathematical methods to choose the most appropriate fit (line vs. curve) rather than just picking the one that gives a desired result.
#### Regression vs. Classification:

- **Regression:** Predicts numerical outputs from an infinite range of possibilities (e.g., house prices).  

- **Classification:** Predicts categorical outputs from a finite, limited set of possibilities (e.g., benign or malignant).

![Classification: Breast Cancer Detection](./images/04-breast-cancer-prediction.png)


**Breast Cancer Detection Example:**

- A machine learning system is designed to help doctors detect breast cancer.  

- The system analyzes patient medical records to determine if a tumor is:

    - **Benign (0):** Non-cancerous, not dangerous.  

    - **Malignant (1):** Cancerous, dangerous.  

- Data is plotted with tumor size on the horizontal axis and benign/malignant (0/1) on the vertical axis.

- This demonstrates a binary classification problem (two possible outputs).

**Key Characteristics of Classification:**

- Predicts a small, finite number of output categories.

- Categories can be numerical (0, 1, 2) or non-numerical (cat, dog).  

- The focus is on assigning inputs to specific categories, not predicting continuous values.  

- The terms output classes and output categories are interchangeable.

**Expanding Classification Categories:**

- Classification can involve more than two categories.

- For example, a cancer diagnosis system could predict multiple types of cancer (e.g., Benign, Malignant-type 1, Malignant-type 2).

#### Unsupervised Learning

- **The Difference in Data:**
    
    - **Supervised Learning:** Data comes with "right answers" or labels ($y$), such as whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
        
    - **Unsupervised Learning:** Data is provided **without labels**. The algorithm is given inputs (like patient age and tumor size) but is not told what the "correct" outcome is.
        
- **The Goal:** Instead of predicting a specific label, the algorithm's job is to find **structure, patterns, or interesting relationships** within the data on its own.
    
- **Why "Unsupervised"?** It is called "unsupervised" because there is no teacher providing the correct answers. The algorithm must figure out the underlying distribution of the data without guidance.

**Clustering: A Primary Example**

- **Mechanism:** The algorithm looks at the data points and identifies natural groupings.
    
- **Example:** In a medical dataset without labels, the algorithm might automatically group data into two distinct "clusters" based on similarities it detects, even if it doesn't know what those clusters represent (e.g., healthy vs. sick).

	![Supervised - Unsupervised Example](./images/05-supervised-unsupervised.png)

**Google News: How Clustering works in a real-world?**

- **Automated Organization:** Every day, Google News analyzes hundreds of thousands of articles and groups them into related stories without human intervention.
    
- **How the Algorithm "Thinks":** The clustering algorithm identifies patterns—such as the repeated appearance of specific words like "panda," "twin," and "zoo"—to determine that certain articles belong in the same group.
    
- **The "Unsupervised" Advantage:** **No Manual Labels:** There is no employee telling the computer which words to look for.
    
    - **Adaptability:** Because news topics change daily, the algorithm must independently figure out what is "interesting" or "related" for that specific day.
        
    - **Scalability:** It is physically impossible for humans to manually categorize the sheer volume of news generated globally; the algorithm handles this at scale.

**Clustering: DNA Microarray**

- **The Data Structure:** Researchers use a grid where each column represents an individual's DNA and each row represents a specific gene (e.g., genes for eye color, height, or even a distaste for certain vegetables).
    
- **The Process:** The algorithm analyzes the "expression" of these genes (represented by colors like red or green) across many different people.
    
- **The Discovery:** A clustering algorithm can automatically group people into different "types" (e.g., Type 1, Type 2, Type 3) based on genetic similarities.
    
- **Why it's Unsupervised:** The researchers do **not** tell the algorithm what the types are in advance.
    
    - There are no "right answers" or labels provided.
        
    - The algorithm must **independently find the structure** and categorize the individuals based solely on the raw data.

**Three Types of Unsupervised Learning**

1. **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together (e.g., Google News stories or DNA types).
    
2. **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual events or outliers. This is critical for **fraud detection** in banking, where a strange transaction might indicate a stolen card.
    
3. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Compressing a large dataset into a smaller one while retaining as much vital information as possible.

### Regression Model

#### Introduction to Linear Regression

- **Definition:** Linear Regression is the process of **fitting a straight line** to a dataset.
    
- **Global Popularity:** It is described as perhaps the most widely used learning algorithm in the world today.

**The Dataset Structure**

- **Data Table:** Beyond just a visual plot, data is organized in a table where:
    
    - **Each Row** represents a specific "example" (e.g., a single house).
        
    - **The Columns** represent the input features (size) and the output labels (price).
        
- **Mapping:** Every row in the table corresponds to exactly one "cross" or data point on the visual graph.

![Linear Regression](./images/07-linear-regression.png)

**Practical Application Example**

- **The Scenario:** You are a real estate agent in Portland.
    
- **The Workflow:** You take a new input (a client's 1250 sq. ft. house), find where it intersects the "best fit line" on your model, and trace it to the output axis to provide a price estimate (e.g., $\$220,000$).

# Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

After the completion of this course, you will be able to:
- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.

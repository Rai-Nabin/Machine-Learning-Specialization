# Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

After the completion of this course, you will be able to:
- Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection. 
- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method. 
- Build a deep reinforcement learning model.

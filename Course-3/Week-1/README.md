# Unsupervised Learning
## Learning Objectives

- Implement the k-means clustering algorithm
- Implement the k-means optimization objective
- Choose the number of clusters for the k-means algorithm
- Implement an anomaly detection system
- Decide when to use supervised learning vs. anomaly detection
- Implement the centroid update function in k-means
-  Implement the function that finds the closest centroids to each point in k-means
## Clustering
**What is clustering?**

A clustering algorithm looks at a number of data points and automatically finds data points that are related or similar to each other.

Given a dataset with features `x1`, `x2` and so on. With supervised learning, we have a training set with both the input features `x` as well as the labels `y`. We could plot a dataset as shown in figure above and fit, say, a logistic regression algorithm or a neural network to learn a decision boundary.
